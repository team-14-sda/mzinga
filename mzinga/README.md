> **Note:** If you use Docker Compose, these variables are automatically picked up from `.env`.

---

## Running with Docker Compose

You can run the stack using Docker Compose in two modes.

### For a Persistent Environment (Recommended)

Use this method to ensure your data (database, uploads, etc.) is saved permanently and survives Docker restarts.

1.  **Create a persistent directory on your machine:**
    Choose a permanent location to store your data, for example, in your home directory.

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/mzinga-data
    ```

2.  **Configure your `.env` file:**
    Set `DRIVER_OPTS_DEVICE` to the **absolute path** of the directory you just created.

    ```sh
    # Example for macOS:
    # DRIVER_OPTS_DEVICE=/Users/your-user/mzinga-data
    #
    # Example for Linux:
    # DRIVER_OPTS_DEVICE=/home/your-user/mzinga-data

    DRIVER_OPTS_DEVICE= # <-- SET YOUR ABSOLUTE PATH HERE
    ```
    Also ensure the other required variables are set:
    ```sh
    MONGO_HOST=[your_192_ip_address]
    DRIVER_OPTS_TYPE="none"
    DRIVER_OPTS_OPTIONS="bind"
    ```

3.  **Start all services:**
    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

### For a Temporary, Disposable Environment

Use this method for quick tests where you do not need to keep your data.

> **Warning:** Using `/tmp` means all your data will be deleted when you shut down or restart Docker.

1.  **Ensure your `.env` file is configured as follows:**

    ```sh
    MONGO_HOST=[your_192_ip_address]
    DRIVER_OPTS_TYPE="none"
    DRIVER_OPTS_OPTIONS="bind"
    DRIVER_OPTS_DEVICE=/tmp
    ```

2.  **Create needed volume folders (and/or clean them up if needed):**
    This command is useful to ensure you start with a clean slate.

    ```sh
    echo "Cleanup"
    rm -rf /tmp/database /tmp/mzinga /tmp/messagebus
    
    echo "Create"
    mkdir -p /tmp/database /tmp/mzinga /tmp/messagebus
    ```

3.  **Start all services:**

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

4.  **Access the app:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port you set in `PORT`).

---

## Running Locally with npm

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the application:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the app:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port you set in `PORT`).

4. **Required services:**
   - **MongoDB:** You can run a local MongoDB instance with:

     ```sh
     docker run --rm -it -d -p 27017:27017 -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin mongo:latest
     ```

   - **Redis (optional, for cache):**

     ```sh
     docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
     ```

---

## Additional Notes

- For development, you can use the default values provided in the `.env` example. You can use the `.env.template` file as a starting point and edit it accordingly.
- If you change ports or credentials, update your `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` accordingly.
- For advanced configuration, see the comments in `docker-compose.yml` and `src/mzinga.config.ts`.

## Webhook Notifications in MZinga

In the MZinga domain, the term **webhook notification** refers to both traditional HTTP webhooks (HTTP POST requests to external URLs) and events published to RabbitMQ. This is a broader definition than in most software projects, where "webhook" typically means only HTTP callbacks. In MZinga, both mechanisms are configured and triggered in the same way, allowing you to integrate with external systems using either HTTP or RabbitMQ.

### How to Send a Webhook Notification (HTTP or RabbitMQ)

1. **Choose the collection and field you want to monitor.**
2. **Set an environment variable in your `.env` file using the following format:**

   ```bash
   HOOKSURL_<COLLECTION_SLUG>_FIELD_<FIELD_NAME>_<HOOK_TYPE>=<WEBHOOK_URL_OR_RABBITMQ>
   ```

   - `<COLLECTION_SLUG>`: The slug of your collection (e.g., `SCHEDULED-TASKS`).
   - `<FIELD_NAME>`: The name of the field (e.g., `LASTEXECUTION`).
   - `<HOOK_TYPE>`: The event type (e.g., `AFTERCHANGE`, `BEFORECHANGE`).
   - `<WEBHOOK_URL_OR_RABBITMQ>`: The HTTP endpoint to notify, or `RABBITMQ` to publish to RabbitMQ.

   **Example for RabbitMQ:**

   ```bash
   HOOKSURL_SCHEDULEDTASKS_FIELD_LASTEXECUTION_AFTERCHANGE=RABBITMQ
   ```

   **Example for HTTP webhook:**

   ```bash
   HOOKSURL_STORIES_FIELD_TITLE_AFTERCHANGE=https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/notify
   ```

3. **If using RabbitMQ, ensure you have set the `RABBITMQ_URL` variable:**

   ```bash
   RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/
   ```

4. **Restart your app** after changing environment variables to apply the new webhook configuration.

### How It Works

- When the specified event occurs (e.g., the `lastExecution` field is updated), MZinga will automatically send a notification to the configured HTTP endpoint or publish an event to RabbitMQ.
- The payload includes details about the event, such as the data, document, operation type, and more.

### Supported Hook Types

- `BEFOREVALIDATE`, `BEFORECHANGE`, `AFTERCHANGE`, `AFTERREAD` (field-level)
- `BEFOREOPERATION`, `BEFOREVALIDATE`, `BEFORECHANGE`, `AFTERCHANGE`, `BEFOREREAD`, `AFTERREAD`, `BEFOREDELETE`, `AFTERDELETE`, `AFTERERROR`, `BEFORELOGIN`, `AFTERLOGIN`, `AFTERLOGOUT`, `AFTERME`, `AFTERREFRESH`, `AFTERFORGOTPASSWORD` (collection-level)

## Best Practices

- **[Naming conventions for Git Branches — a Cheatsheet](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534)**
- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification):** A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages
- **Use Consistent Naming:** Ensure that your page titles and file names are consistent to make navigation easier.
- **Organize Hierarchically:** Group related pages and files under parent folders for logical organization.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep your documentation up-to-date with project changes.
- **Use Templates:** For frequently used structures, create templates to standardize documentation.
